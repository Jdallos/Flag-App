# Flag App

## Flag app is a react app driven by the REST COUNTRIES API.

This app was inspired by my 3 year old nephew who memorized close to 100 different flags and the associated country names!

Flag App allows the user to search through all countries flags, a specific flag can be selected to discover more information on the country such as population size, currency, area etc. Flags can be saved (and removed) from a saved flags list to allow quick access to specific information. Saved flags are stored in local storage.

Flag App is a fun, intuitive app designed to be educational and informative for all ages. Currently the app is not fully responsive and works best on a desktop or laptop screen.


 ### Technical notes:

Special care was taken in order to:

    -Match Flags already in local storage with incoming API data in order to prevent duplication.

    -Randomize flag order each time the user engages with the app in order to increase the chnaces of discovering a new flag!

    -Increase UX by incorperating the Unspash API to provide country related images where possible.

### Updates:

In the future I hope to add:

    -A search function

    -A Flag quiz, matching Flags to the correct country name/ other data.

I hope you enjoy using Flag App.
